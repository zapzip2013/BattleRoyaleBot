Description: A Discord Bot that runs a battle royale style game with randomly generated events and actions based on limited player input

There is no user interface, to interface with the bot, you must be on a discord server with the bot running.
here is an invite link to a server with the bot added: https://discord.gg/3Bg3ES5
In order to make the bot go online you must run the program on your computer
Once the bot is online(it will send a message to notify you of this) you can send it commands in the form of !command, where command is replaced with your command
!help gives a list of commands, their descriptions, and info on how to play the game
before starting the game, type !initiate
and then each player should type !addme
each player will be given their own channel in which to send commands
send !startgame once all players have send !addme
each player has 3 actions, commands that take an action are denoted with an asterisk(*) in the !help message
after an hour, the bot will generate events for every player and announce them
once this happens each player's 3 actions are restored
this continues until there are either 1 or 0 players remaining

bugs:
-certain typos in the command names mess things up a lot
-issues with the !map command
